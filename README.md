# Reacting to React
A little experiment with React. I'm sure JSX is great but its not for me so I've tried to follow the [React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) without using it and it's not bad actually.

Hat-tip to @jackfranklin for his excellent [talk](http://asyncjs.com/getting-started-with-es6-modules-today/) and [examples](https://github.com/jackfranklin/jspm-es6-react-example)

## Setup
```shell
npm install
npm start 
open http://localhost:3000/
```
